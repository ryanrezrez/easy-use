# ComfyUI Easy Use
</div>

**ComfyUI-Easy-Use** is a simplified node integration package, which is extended on the basis of [tinyterraNodes](https://github.com/TinyTerra/ComfyUI_tinyterraNodes), and has been integrated and optimized for many mainstream node packages to achieve the purpose of faster and more convenient use of ComfyUI. While ensuring the degree of freedom, it restores the ultimate smooth image production experience that belongs to Stable Diffusion.

## Introduce

### Random seed control before generate

### Separate sampling parameters from sample preview

### Wildcard prompt nodes are supported

Support `.yaml`, `.txt`, `.json` format wildcard files, just place them in the 'wildcards' folder of the node package, and update the file to run ComfyUI again. <br>
To use the Lora Block Weight usage, make sure that [ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack) is installed in the custom node package.

### UI interface is beautified

After installing the node package, the UI interface will be automatically switched, if you need to change other themes, please switch and refresh the page in Settings -> Color Palette.
